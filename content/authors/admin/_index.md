John Karuitha teaches finance at Karatina University, Kenya. He attained his PhD in Finance from Wits University, Johannesburg in 2021. His research interests are in financial intermediation, specifically microfinance and financial inclusion. Karuitha also has research interests in rural and agribusiness finance, and the applications of data science and machine learning tools to solving problems in finance, moreso in Africa.
