abstract: Corporations  split  their  shares  in  order  to  make  them  more  affordable  to  the  retail  investors.  Theoretically, increased buying of the stock post split by retail investors should be experienced. Existing literature on effect of stock  splits  are  from  studies  conducted  in  developed  markets,  much  of  it  focusing  on  market  efficiency.  The objective of this study  was to analyze the effect of stock  splits on ownership structure of  listed firms in Kenya. Using  a  data  collection  sheet,  secondary  data  was  collected  from  the  published  financial  statements  of  listed firms,  which  had  conducted  stock  splits  between  2004  and  2010.  A  Herfindahl-  Hirschman  Index  was  used to measure ownership concentration among the top ten  shareholders before and after the split. The overall change in  ownership  structure  was  analyzed  using  the  Wilcoxon  Rank  Sum  Test  at  95%  confidence  level.  The  results show that although the ownership structure for the companies in the study significantly changed, the change was generally  not  in  favor  of  retail  investors.  Contrary  to  expectations,  the  holding  by  institutional  investors significantly  increased  in  most  cases,  implying  that  stock  splits  do  not  cause  enough  interest  in  the shares amongst retail investors to tilt the proportions owned in their favor. To the contrary, stock split encourages retail investors  to  off  load  their  shares  in  a  bid  to  lock  in  profits  occasioned  by  the  appreciation  in  the  value  of  the shares after the split. An important recommendation for market regulators and corporate managers is that a stock split  may  not  be  a  useful  tool  for  dispersing  firm ownership  but  rather  only  for  improving  stock  liquidity. Investors  looking  to  buy  stocks  that  have  announced  a  stock  split  should  carefully  analyze  their  information content, because during stock market bubble a split  may  not convey accurate future prospects for the company. Given the increased demand for stocks when a split is announced, it is an ample opportunity to lock in profits for investors looking to sell their shares.
